In this article I list some useful [VS Code (Visual Studio Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions I use while developing Python.

## Extensions

### [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) 

> IntelliSense (Pylance), Linting, Debugging (multi-threaded, remote), Jupyter Notebooks, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, and more.
  
Overall the most extensive Python extension. Simple features like code highlighting goes a long way.

### [AutoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring)

> Generates python docstrings automatically

Generates a nice boiletplate for docstrings. Please use type hints.

### [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

> Jupyter notebook support, interactive programming and computing that supports Intellisense, debugging and more.

I love debugging and writing examples with Jupyter Notebooks and this extension offers good support for them in VS Code. Notebooks are helpful especially
for scientists.

### [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)

> View a Git Graph of your repository, and perform Git actions from the graph.

I like the visual representation of the Git graph. However, I still do most of the actions in command line.

### [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)

> Open any folder on a remote machine using SSH and take advantage of VS Code's full feature set.

Helpful if I have to SSH to a remote machine and inspect or code something remotely. Game changer for me.

### [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

> All you need to write Markdown (keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview and more)

As documenting the code or generally writing something in Markdown, this extension is helpful - especially the preview feature and syntax highligting.
Especially as posts in this blog is written in Markdown.

### [reStructuredTest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext)

> reStructuredText language support (RST/ReST linter, preview, IntelliSense and more)

Code documentation helper, especially when working with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

# Conclusion

Normal Python development does not need that many extensions (individual preference).

I have not tested any of the AI assisted extensions, which is something I should do in the future.

Of course when developing with multiple programming languages, the extension list will grow.
